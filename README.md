Why Create a Pipeline (CI/CD)?
<br>
Automate Workflow (no more manually running tests, building code or deploying to production - a pipeline automates these steps every time you push code.
<br>
Catch Bugs Early (CI - Continous Integration) / Every commit can trigger the pipeline to run tests or builds, this helps catch issues immediately.
<br>
Deploy with Confidence (CD -Continous Delivery / Deployment)
<br>
Better Testing and QA (Easily integrate unit tests, integration tests and code coverage reports)
<br>
Build Once, Use Anywhere (Pipelines produce artifacts that can be used in multiple environments without rebuilding each time)
<br>
Seamless Integration With Tools (Azure DevOps integrates with Azure services, Git, Docker, Teams etc.)
<br>
Prerequisites : A GitHub account where I can create a repository, An Azure Public DevOps organization, An Azure Public DevOps project.
