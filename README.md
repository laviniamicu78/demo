Why Create a Pipeline (CI/CD)?
Automate Workflow (no more manually running tests, building code or deploying to production - a pipeline automates these steps every time you push code.
Catch Bugs Early (CI - Continous Integration) / Every commit can trigger the pipeline to run tests or builds, this helps catch issues immediately.
Deploy with Confidence (CD -Continous Delivery / Deployment)
Better Testing and QA (Easily integrate unit tests, integration tests and code coverage reports)
Build Once, Use Anywhere (Pipelines produce artifacts that can be used in multiple environments without rebuilding each time)
Seamless Integration With Tools (Azure DevOps integrates with Azure services, Git, Docker, Teams etc.)
